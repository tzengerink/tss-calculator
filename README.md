Calculate weekly TSS based on target fitness

## What is Training Stress Score (TSS)?

By using Training Stress Score (TSS) you can gain points for virtually any sport or activity. This allows any endurance athlete the ability to quantify their workouts based on their relative intensity, duration, and frequency of workouts. One single value can now represent how hard, and how long you worked out.
